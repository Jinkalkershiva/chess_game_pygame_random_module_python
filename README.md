# Chess Game (Python + Pygame)

This is a Chess project created by **Jinkalker Shiva** using **Python** and **Pygame**. It implements the basic rules of chess and uses chess piece images to display a realistic board. The player controls the **white pieces**, while the **black pieces are controlled by a simple random-move AI**. The board is fully interactive, and moves follow chess rules such as valid piece movement and capturing.

## Introduction
Chess is a strategy game played between two players, and this project brings the game to life with Pygame. The board is drawn with alternating colors, and chess pieces are represented using image files. White pieces are controlled by the user via mouse clicks, while black pieces make automated random moves. This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates how to combine Python logic with Pygame graphics.

## About the Project
- Developed in **Python 3** using the **Pygame library**.  
- The chessboard is drawn with alternating white and brown squares.  
- Chess pieces are represented with images (`images/white_pawn.png`, `images/black_queen.png`, etc.).  
- The user can click to select and move pieces.  
- The AI (black side) makes random valid moves.  
- Includes highlighting of selected pieces and possible valid moves.  

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3 (preferably Python 3.8 or higher).  
2. Install Pygame: !pip install pygame .
3. Clone or download this repository.  
4. Ensure the folder `images/` is present in the same directory as the code and contains all required chess piece images:  
5. Run the program:  
6. The chessboard window will open, and you can start playing as white.

## Features
- Chessboard drawn with Pygame graphics  
- Chess pieces represented using image files  
- Click-to-select and move pieces for white  
- Simple AI for black (random valid moves)  
- Highlighting of selected piece and valid moves
